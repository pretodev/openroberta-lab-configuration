# Open Roberta visualization config 

Open Roberta Lab is a learning platform that uses graphical programming language (based on blockly) to generate code for robots and embedded systems for educational purposes. The platform has a configuration tab to define the connections of the devices used. The problem is that this guide is not user friendly. My proposal is to add a more realistic view in the configuration tab, using images like those on fritzing.org, allowing the user to add sensors/actuators in a user-friendly way.

#### Requirements

- HTTP Server. As a suggestion, use Visual Code Studio live server.

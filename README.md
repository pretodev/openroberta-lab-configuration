# Open Roberta visualization configuration 

Open Roberta Lab is a learning platform that uses graphical programming language (based on blockly) to generate code for robots and embedded systems for educational purposes. The platform has a configuration tab to define the connections of the devices used. The problem is that this guide is not user friendly. My proposal is to add a more realistic view in the configuration tab, using images like those on fritzing.org, allowing the user to add sensors/actuators in a user-friendly way.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/santorsilas/openroberta-lab-configuration.git

cd openroberta-lab-configuration

npm install
```

## Run playground

```

npm run playground

```
